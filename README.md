# Data-Structure and algorithm 

# Fundamental Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java and Python implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures, inspired by the curriculum of Princeton University. It serves as an educational resource for understanding and applying key concepts in computer science, with an emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

### Part I: Elementary Data Structures, Sorting, and Searching

Covers basic data structures and algorithms for sorting and searching, including:

- Union-Find
- Binary Search
- Stacks, Queues, Bags
- Various Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Heaps
- Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees
- Hash Tables
- Geometric Algorithms and kd-Trees

### Part II: Graph and String-Processing Algorithms

Focuses on advanced topics in graph theory and string processing, including:

- Graph Algorithms
- String-Processing Algorithms
- Compression and Encoding Algorithms
- Reductions and Intractability
